### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Attention

#### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Publication)

1. **Missing LICENSE File**
   - Status: **CRITICAL**
   - package.json declares "MIT" license but LICENSE file doesn't exist
   - Required for marketplace publication
   - Legal requirement for open source distribution

2. **Publisher Information Incomplete**
   - Current publisher: `"tba"` (to be announced)
   - Must set actual publisher ID before publication
   - Repository URL placeholder: `https://github.com/yourusername/hajime`
   - Must update to actual repository

3. **Icon Requirements**
   - Current icon: SVG format (sumo-icon.svg)
   - Marketplace requirement: 128x128px PNG
   - SVG works in VS Code but not optimal for marketplace listing

4. **Package.json Issues**
   - Missing recommended fields:
     - `icon` field for marketplace listing
     - `galleryBanner` for visual branding
     - `badges` for quality indicators
     - `bugs` field for issue tracking URL
     - `homepage` for extension homepage
     - `qna` field for Q&A location

#### High Priority Issues

5. **Code Quality - Linting Errors**
   - ESLint shows 91+ warnings/errors including:
     - 20+ `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` errors
     - Naming convention warnings (REGIONS, COLLECTORS_API, etc.)
     - Missing curly braces in conditionals
     - Unused variables
   - While not blocking publication, reduces code quality

6. **Test Files in Package**
   - .vscodeignore excludes `src/**` but test files are being packaged:
     - All test suites (out/test/**/*.js)
     - Test results (test-results/*)
   - Increases package size unnecessarily
   - Should exclude from published extension

7. **Output/Data Files in Package**
   - output/ directory with profile-specific data is included
   - Contains:
     - User-specific query results
     - Metadata JSON files
     - Collector exports
   - Should be excluded via .vscodeignore

8. **Development Files Included**
   - temp_new_commands.txt
   - project summary.md
   - README_OLD.md
   - TESTING.md, INTEGRATION_TESTING.md, TEST_RESULTS.md
   - .claude/ directory
   - search_examples/ directory
   - Should be excluded from package

#### Medium Priority Issues

9. **No Screenshot/GIF Demos**
   - README references images in docs/images/:
     - sumo buttons.png
     - query.webview.output.png
     - category.echart.png
     - timeseries.transpose.echart.png
   - These enhance marketplace listing appeal
   - Currently docs/ folder is excluded via .vscodeignore
   - Should include select images for marketplace

10. **CHANGELOG Format**
    - Current CHANGELOG is informal
    - Should follow Keep a Changelog format more strictly
    - No version history with dates
    - Current content is all "[Unreleased]"

11. **Version Number**
    - Currently 0.0.3 (pre-release indicator)
    - Consider 0.1.0 for initial marketplace release
    - Follow semantic versioning

12. **Missing .vscode/settings.json Recommendations**
    - No workspace recommendations for extension development
    - Could help contributors

#### Low Priority Issues

13. **No CI/CD Pipeline**
    - No GitHub Actions or other CI setup
    - No automated testing on commits
    - No automated publishing workflow

14. **No Contributing Guidelines**
    - CONTRIBUTING.md doesn't exist
    - Would help potential contributors

15. **No Security Policy**
    - No SECURITY.md for vulnerability reporting
    - Good practice for security-sensitive extension (handles credentials)
